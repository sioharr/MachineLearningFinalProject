# MachineLearningFinalProject
The PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is a test administered to 15 year olds in over 70 countries every 3 years.  This test included an extensive survey and therefore contains a rich set of data (over 922 fields in the 2015 version).  There are surveys for students, teachers, and school with a wide variety of questions ranging from "how much time do you spend in math class" to "how many books are in your home".

Our team set out to find predictive elements from the survey questions for Americans that would help determine at risk youth merely by administering the survey rather than administering the test.  We learned a lot about variable selection and omitted variables.  While some variables were correlated with better scores, our accuracy rates were not impressive across a wide variety of models.

The deliverables include our code and a presentation that explains what we tried and how we did.
